# Implementing Dynamic Stylesheets

Typically, the core stylesheet(s) that control the overall theme for your website are loaded in the `<head>` portion of your HTML. Here's some research I did on injecting content into the `<head>` in Blazor 8; the results are from Bing's AI.

> In **Blazor 8**, you can control the content in the `<head>` section of your web pages. Here's how you can achieve that:
>
> 1. **Page Title**:
>
>    To set the page title, use the `PageTitle` component. For example:
>    ```razor
>    <PageTitle>Your Page Title</PageTitle>
>    ```
>
> 2. **Other Head Content**:
>
>    To add other content to the `<head>` section (such as meta tags), use the `HeadContent` component. For example:
>    ```razor
>    <HeadContent>
>        <meta name="description" content="Your description here">
>    </HeadContent>
>    ```
>
> 3. **HeadOutlet Component**:
>
>    In your `Program.cs` file (for Blazor WebAssembly), add the `HeadOutlet` component:
>    ```csharp
>    builder.RootComponents.Add<HeadOutlet>("head::after");
>    ```
>    This component allows you to inject content into the `<head>` section.
>
> Remember to adjust the content and placement according to your specific requirements! 😊

> My response was based on the official documentation from Microsoft Learn¹, which explains how to control the head content in ASP.NET Core Blazor apps. I also used a blog post from I ️ DotNet³ as a reference for the steps to add the HeadOutlet, PageTitle, and HeadContent components. These are the most relevant and up-to-date resources that I found using my web search tool. I hope this helps! 👍

### `<HeadOutlet>` and `<HeadContent>`

These two Blazor components work together, with the `<HeadOutlet>` acting as the "placeholder" for receiving content from instances of the `<HeadContent>`. So, if you want to use this, you can place a `<HeadOutlet>` in your `App.razor`'s `<head>` element and then have one or more individual pages provide injectable content through a `<HeadContent>` component.

> Blazor 8 is a framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET¹. It provides several components to control the content of the HTML head section, such as the page title and meta tags. Two of these components are **HeadOutlet** and **HeadContent**.
>
> The **HeadOutlet** component is a placeholder that renders content provided by other components, such as **PageTitle** and **HeadContent**. It is usually placed in the **App.razor** file, inside the `<head>` element².
>
> The **HeadContent** component is used to provide content to the **HeadOutlet** component, such as a `<meta>` tag. It can be used in any Blazor component, including pages and layouts. It accepts a **RenderFragment** as its child content².
>
> Here is an example of how to use these components to set the page title and description using Razor:
>
> ```razor
> @page "/head-content-example"
>
> <PageTitle>Head Content Example</PageTitle>
>
> <h1>Head Content Example</h1>
> <p>This is an example of how to use HeadOutlet and HeadContent components.</p>
>
> <HeadContent>
>     <meta name="description" content="This is a Blazor 8 example.">
> </HeadContent>
> ```
>
> I hope this helps you understand the difference between **HeadOutlet** and **HeadContent** components in Blazor 8. 😊

> > **[Me:]** Does the `<HeadOutlet>` support default content?
>
> According to the documentation¹, the `<HeadOutlet>` component does not support default content. It only renders the content provided by the `<HeadContent>` component that matches its name or id. If there are multiple `<HeadContent>` components with the same name or id, the `<HeadOutlet>` component renders the content of the last rendered `<HeadContent>` component². This feature can be leveraged to provide default section content³.
