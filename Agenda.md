  - **What is a Computer Program**
    - *A computer program is a **set of instructions** for manipulating **information**.*
    - Information: Primitve Types & Complex Types
      - Primitive types: Textual, Numeric, Conceptual
      - Complex types: Classes (`class`), `struct`, `record`
        - A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
        - It describes what an object will *look like* and how it will *behave*.
        - `class` is made up of fields, properties, methods and constructors.
    - Kinds of programs:
      - CLI (console w. UI)
      - Desktop
      - Web
      - Others: (scheduled jobs, server apps, edge applications, etc.)
